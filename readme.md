Advent Of Code 2022
===================

I've become obsessed with Day 09... The Rope Bridge.

After getting the answer right I wanted to see it. I initially wrote it in Odin,
then for the visualization I wrote it again in Rust doing the WASM thing and
animating it with Unicode emoji which was neat, but then I wanted to do more Odin.

So back to this place, back to this time, again and again...

What? Nevermind. I wanted to learn Raylib in Odin. It was easier, this time, at
least in the beginning. At the moment, I'm trying to get textured rendering going,
which means shaders and whatnot, and I will have to come back to that.

Until next time...
